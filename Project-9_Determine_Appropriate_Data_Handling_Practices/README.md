## 🎯 Activity Overview

In this project, I conducted an analysis of a real-world data leak scenario involving a violation of the principle of least privilege. I reviewed a data risk assessment and evaluated the existing privacy controls at a fictional educational technology company. The investigation revealed a lack of access control and oversight that led to confidential business documents being shared publicly.

Based on this analysis, I recommended improvements aligned with the [NIST SP 800-53 AC-6](https://csf.tools/reference/nist-sp-800-53/r5/ac/ac-6) guideline on access control. These included limiting link sharing and implementing automatic expiration of shared content. The goal was to enhance privacy, mitigate risks, and enforce more effective access control policies.
