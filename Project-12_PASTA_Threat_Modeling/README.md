# ðŸ§  Portfolio Activity: Analyze Threats Using the PASTA Framework

## ðŸ“š Course Context  
**Module:** Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities  
**Program:** Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Activity Overview  

In this project, I explored the PASTA threat modeling methodology â€” an industry-recognized framework for systematically identifying and addressing security threats. The activity simulated a scenario in which I needed to assess potential risks to an organization by walking through the seven stages of the PASTA framework, from understanding business objectives to identifying countermeasures.

This approach helped me practice threat modeling as a proactive security strategy. It involved analyzing how attackers could exploit specific vulnerabilities and developing a layered defense model aligned with business goals.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Frameworks Used  

- **PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)**  
- **Threat modeling techniques**  
- **Asset-based risk analysis**  
- **Business Impact Assessment (BIA)**  

---

## ðŸ§  Skills Developed  

- Applying the seven stages of the PASTA threat model  
- Identifying attack vectors and threat actors based on business processes  
- Evaluating system vulnerabilities and potential impacts  
- Recommending mitigation strategies aligned with business risk tolerance  
- Bridging technical risks with business-level objectives  

---

## âœ… What I Learned  

- How PASTA provides a structured approach to threat modeling  
- The importance of aligning threat modeling with organizational priorities  
- How to simulate real-world attacker behavior and evaluate risks  
- How to prioritize security controls based on impact and likelihood  
- The value of continuous threat analysis as part of risk management

## ðŸ“Œ Outcome  

This exercise demonstrated my ability to think like both a defender and an attacker, using structured threat modeling to uncover security weaknesses. It enhanced my skills in aligning cybersecurity strategy with operational needs and showcased my competency in applying frameworks like PASTA in professional environments.
