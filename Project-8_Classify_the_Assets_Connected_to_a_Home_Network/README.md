# 🏠 Portfolio Activity: Classify the Assets Connected to a Home Network

## 📝 Overview

In this activity, I conducted a basic **asset classification exercise** focused on a home network used to operate a small business. The objective was to identify devices connected to the network, document key characteristics, and assign a **sensitivity classification** based on their importance and potential impact on the business if compromised.

Effective **asset management** is a core principle of cybersecurity. It starts with creating an **asset inventory** and assigning levels of protection based on each asset’s criticality and exposure.

## 🔍 Key Tasks Completed

- ✅ Identified three unique devices connected to the home network.
- ✅ Documented device characteristics: **owner**, **network access**, **physical location**.
- ✅ Evaluated each device’s role, behavior, and potential risks.
- ✅ Assigned **sensitivity levels** (e.g., Confidential, Internal, Public, Restricted) to each asset.
- ✅ Recorded insights about data sensitivity, network exposure, and owner habits.

## 📋 Devices Classified

Examples of devices included in the asset inventory:

- 📱 Guest smartphone  
- 🖥️ Secondary laptop used for business tasks  
- 🎮 Gaming console shared with guests
- 📹 Smart security camera

Each device was reviewed for:

- Frequency and method of **network access**
- **Ownership** and user behavior (e.g., secure habits)
- **Location** relative to the router
- Sensitivity of stored information (e.g., photos, business files, login credentials)

## 🔐 Sensitivity Classification

Assets were classified using the following categories:

- 🔴 **Confidential** – High-risk if compromised  
- 🟠 **Internal** – Limited to authorized users  
- 🟡 **Public** – No restrictions; minimal risk  
- 🟢 **Restricted** – Requires strict access controls  

This classification helps prioritize protection strategies and resource allocation.

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

By completing this task, I strengthened my understanding of **inventorying network-connected assets** and evaluating their security posture. I learned how to assess real-world factors—like usage patterns and physical setup—that impact the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of data on a network.

## 🚦 Status

🟢 **Completed** – All steps of the classification process were finalized and documented.
