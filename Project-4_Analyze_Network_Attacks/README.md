# 🛡️ Portfolio Activity: Analyze Network Attacks

## 📚 Course Context
**Module:** Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security  
**Program:** Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate

---

## 🎯 Activity Overview

In this activity, I encountered a simulated scenario where a customer was unable to access the company’s website due to a service disruption. As a security analyst, I was tasked with identifying the most likely cause of the issue, explaining how the attack was carried out, and describing the negative impact it had on both the website and the organization.

I used a **packet sniffer** to capture traffic and observed an abnormal volume of **TCP SYN** requests, which indicated a **Denial-of-Service (DoS)** attack targeting the web server. I took action to mitigate the issue and reported findings to management with recommendations for response and future prevention.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- Packet sniffer / Network analyzer (e.g., **WireShark**)
- TCP/IP protocol (focus on **SYN flood attacks**)  
- IP address monitoring and blocking  
- Network traffic diagnostics

---

## 🧠 Skills Developed

- Identification of DoS attack patterns
- Network log analysis using Wireshark
- Drafting and structuring a cybersecurity incident report  
- Interpretation of TCP SYN traffic anomalies  
- Communication of incident details to non-technical stakeholders  
- Decision-making under active network threat conditions

---

## ✅ What I Learned

- How to recognize signs of a SYN flood DoS attack using packet-level data.
- The use of Wireshark for analyzing real-time network traffic and identifying malicious activity.
- The importance of swift mitigation and response strategies to minimize downtime.  
- Techniques for isolating malicious IP traffic and restoring web server functionality.  
- How to document and communicate technical incidents clearly in a business context.  
- The limitations of short-term IP blocking and the need for broader defensive measures.

## 📌 Outcome

A strengthened understanding of how to detect, analyze, and respond to real-world network-layer attacks. This exercise improved my ability to interpret packet-level indicators and react to service disruptions caused by malicious activity.
