# ðŸ§  Portfolio Activity: Identify the Attack Vectors of a USB Drive

## ðŸ“š Course Context  
**Module:** Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities  
**Program:** Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Activity Overview

In this project, I investigated a potential USB baiting attack discovered in a hospital parking lot. The USB drive contained both personal and professional files, including sensitive human resources information. Using a secure virtualized environment, I assessed how the data could be exploited by an attacker and evaluated the risks of connecting unknown devices to organizational systems.

Applying an attacker mindset, I considered how such files might serve as a distraction while malicious code installs in the background. I then conducted a risk analysis of the situation and recommended technical and policy-based controls to mitigate similar threats in the future.
