# ðŸ§® Portfolio Activity: Apply Filters to SQL Queries

## ðŸ“š Course Context
**Module:** Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL  
**Program:** Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Activity Overview

In this project, I applied SQL filtering techniques to investigate potential cybersecurity issues within organizational datasets. I worked with login and employee information to identify failed logins, analyze suspicious activity outside of Mexico, and filter employee records by department and location. This helped simulate real-world threat detection and data analysis scenarios using SQL.

Using `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators, I filtered for specific login patterns, employee attributes, and time-based activityâ€”critical steps in responding to incidents involving unauthorized access or unusual behavior.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language)  
- SQL Operators: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `LIKE`  
- Filtering by `login_time`, `login_date`, `country`, `department`, `office`  
- Data tables: `log_in_attempts`, `employees`

---

## ðŸ§  Skills Developed

- Writing SQL queries with complex filters  
- Using pattern matching with `LIKE`  
- Applying Boolean logic in query construction  
- Filtering time-based and location-based login records  
- Investigating real-world login anomalies and employee access patterns

---

## âœ… What I Learned

- How to construct SQL queries to retrieve failed login attempts after business hours  
- How to filter records based on specific dates and date ranges  
- How to exclude records from a query using `NOT` with pattern matching  
- The importance of data-driven investigation during potential security incidents  
- Real-world use cases where SQL enables deep insight into authentication and access behavior

## ðŸ“Œ Outcome

This project strengthened my ability to analyze and interpret datasets using SQL in the context of cybersecurity operations. I practiced identifying malicious login attempts, filtering employee information, and generating insights useful for both technical teams and incident responders.
