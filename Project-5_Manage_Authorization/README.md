# 🔐 Portfolio Activity: Manage Authorization

## 📚 Course Context
**Module:** Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL  
**Program:** Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate

---

## 🎯 Activity Overview

In this hands-on lab, I practiced managing user authorization by examining and modifying file permissions in a Linux environment. I used Bash shell commands to inspect permission settings, identify misconfigurations, and apply corrective actions to secure files and directories.

This activity is foundational for any cybersecurity analyst who needs to control access to sensitive system resources. It emphasized the importance of least privilege and demonstrated how improperly set permissions can create security vulnerabilities.
