# 🔐 Portfolio Activity: Improve Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting for a Small Business

## 📚 Course Context  
**Module:** Authentication and Access Control  
**Program:** Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate  

---

## 🎯 Activity Overview

In this project, I investigated a cybersecurity incident involving an unauthorized payroll transaction in a small business. By analyzing event logs and comparing them with employee access records, I identified key weaknesses in the organization’s authentication and authorization practices.

The investigation revealed poor access control hygiene, including shared credentials and lack of account deprovisioning. Based on the AAA security framework—Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting—I recommended corrective actions such as enforcing unique credentials and implementing role-based access control (RBAC).
