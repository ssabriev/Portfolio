## Portfolio Projects Overview

Welcome to my Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate portfolio. Below you will find a collection of projects and exercises I completed during the program. Each project showcases practical skills and knowledge gained through hands-on activities and real-world scenarios.

Click on any project title to view detailed documentation, reports, and reflections related to the specific activity.

### Projects and Exercises

- **[Project 0: Professional Statement](./Project-0_Professional-Statement/)**  
  A personal professional statement outlining my cybersecurity career goals, motivations, and strengths. This foundational activity helped me articulate my passion and readiness for the field.

- **[Project 1: Conduct a Security Audit](./Project-1_Security-Audit/)**  
  A comprehensive security audit performed on a fictional organization, identifying key assets, vulnerabilities, and recommending risk mitigation strategies. This project highlights my ability to apply risk management concepts effectively.

- **[Project 2: Use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to Respond to a Security Incident](./Project-2_Security-Audit_DDoS%20attack%20Security%20Plan%20(NIST%20CSF)/)**  
  In this project, I applied the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to respond to a simulated cybersecurity incident. The activity demonstrates how I used the five core functions—Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover—to assess and manage the situation. This exercise reflects a real-world approach to structured incident response and strategic risk mitigation.
