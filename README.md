## Portfolio Projects Overview

Welcome to my Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate portfolio. Below you will find a collection of projects and exercises I completed during the program. Each project showcases practical skills and knowledge gained through hands-on activities and real-world scenarios.

Click on any project title to view detailed documentation, reports, and reflections related to the specific activity.

### Projects and Exercises

- **[Project 0: Professional Statement](./Project-0_Professional-Statement/)**  
  A personal professional statement outlining my cybersecurity career goals, motivations, and strengths. This foundational activity helped me articulate my passion and readiness for the field.

- **[Project 1: Conduct a Security Audit](./Project-1_Security-Audit/)**  
  A comprehensive security audit performed on a fictional organization, identifying key assets, vulnerabilities, and recommending risk mitigation strategies. This project highlights my ability to apply risk management concepts effectively.

- **[Project 2: Use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to Respond to a Security Incident](./Project-2_Security-Audit_DDoS%20attack%20Security%20Plan%20(NIST%20CSF)/)**  
  In this project, I applied the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to respond to a simulated cybersecurity incident. The activity demonstrates how I used the five core functions—Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover—to assess and manage the situation. This exercise reflects a real-world approach to structured incident response and strategic risk mitigation.

- **[Project 3: Analyze Network Layer Communication](./Project-3_Analyze_Network_Layer_Communication)**  
  This project focuses on analyzing DNS and ICMP traffic using a network protocol analyzer. It demonstrates how security analysts use protocol-level data to identify potential threats and reinforce network defenses.

- **[Project 4: Analyze Network Attacks](./Project-4_Analyze_Network_Attacks)** – I investigated a simulated denial-of-service (DoS) incident by analyzing abnormal TCP SYN traffic using Wireshark. I identified the attack pattern, documented my findings, and created a formal Cybersecurity Incident Report outlining the nature of the attack, its impact, and recommended mitigation strategies.
  
- **[Project 5: Manage Authorization](Project-5_Manage_Authorization)**  
Used Linux commands in the Bash shell to inspect and modify file and directory permissions. Practiced identifying incorrect access rights and applying proper permission settings to protect sensitive data and restrict unauthorized access.

- **[Project 6: Apply Filters to SQL Queries](Project-6_Apply_filters%20_to_%20SQL_queries)**  
Used SQL to investigate login anomalies and employee activity by filtering datasets with `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `LIKE` operators. Queried failed logins after hours, isolated suspicious access outside of Mexico, and retrieved records based on department and location. Practiced data-driven incident investigation using realistic scenarios.

- **[Project-7_Score_Risks_Likelihood_Severity](Project-7_Score_Risks_Likelihood_Severity)**: Performed a qualitative risk assessment based on NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1. Identified and scored key threats, then recommended mitigations including MFA, AAA, PoLP, and defense-in-depth strategies.
  
- **[Project-8_Classify_Assets_Home_Network](Project-8_Classify_the_Assets_Connected_to_a_Home_Network)**: Created an asset inventory for a home business network. Classified devices by sensitivity and risk exposure based on network access, ownership, and location to support effective asset management.

- **[Project-9_Determine_Appropriate_Data_Handling_Practices](./Project-9_Determine_Appropriate_Data_Handling_Practices):** An analysis was conducted of a data breach incident caused by a failure to adhere to the principle of least privilege. Existing controls under **[NIST SP 800-53 AC-6](https://csf.tools/reference/nist-sp-800-53/r5/ac/ac-6)** were evaluated, gaps were identified, and improvements were proposed to ensure more secure handling of sensitive information within the organization.

- **[Project X: Improve Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting for a Small Business](Project-X-Project-X-Access-Control-AAA):** In this activity, I investigated a payroll incident involving unauthorized account access within a small business. I analyzed event logs, identified issues with shared access and missing deprovisioning, and proposed mitigations such as enforcing unique credentials and role-based access. The project applies the AAA framework (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) to strengthen access control and reduce future risk.
