# 🛡️ Portfolio Activity: Analyze Network Layer Communication

## 📚 Course Context
**Module:** Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security  
**Program:** Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate

---

## 🎯 Activity Overview

In this activity, the objective is to analyze **DNS** and **ICMP** traffic in transit using data gathered from a **network protocol analyzer** tool. The goal is to identify which network protocol was used during the assessment of a cybersecurity incident and understand its role in the broader context of the TCP/IP model.

You will explore how the **internet layer**—specifically the **IP protocol**—formats data into datagrams. These **IP datagrams** can reveal valuable information to security analysts investigating suspicious network behavior.

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

- Interpret DNS and ICMP traffic from a packet capture (PCAP).
- Identify malicious or anomalous activity at the network layer.
- Assess how attackers might exploit weaknesses in protocols.
- Reinforce network security through detailed protocol analysis.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- Network protocol analyzer (e.g., **tcpdump**)
- DNS (Domain Name System)
- ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
- IP Protocol (TCP/IP Model)

---

## 🧠 Skills Developed

- Network traffic analysis  
- Understanding of TCP/IP model layers  
- Identification of potential threats in transit  
- Application of cybersecurity principles at the network layer  

---

## ✅ What I Learned

- How to use a packet analyzer to inspect and interpret real network traffic.  
- The structure and behavior of **DNS** and **ICMP** messages in transit.  
- How suspicious traffic patterns (such as unusual ICMP echo requests) may indicate scanning or reconnaissance behavior.  
- The role of IP datagrams in providing contextual clues for identifying cyber threats.  
- Practical methods to monitor and strengthen network security at the protocol level.

## 📌 Outcome

A deeper understanding of how communication at the network layer can be both a tool and a target in cybersecurity. The ability to analyze and interpret protocol-level data prepares professionals to defend against common types of cyberattacks.
