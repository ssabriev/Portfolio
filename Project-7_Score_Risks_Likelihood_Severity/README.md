# 📊 Project 7: Score Risks Based on Their Likelihood and Severity

## 📝 Overview

In this activity, I performed a qualitative **risk assessment** of a business-critical information system using the guidance of [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/30/r1/final). The goal was to **identify potential threats**, assign **likelihood and severity scores**, calculate a **risk rating**, and **propose actionable mitigations** to protect sensitive data.

This exercise deepened my understanding of how to assess vulnerabilities and prioritize limited resources based on **business impact and risk exposure**.

## 🔍 Key Tasks Completed

- ✅ Described the **purpose** of the system and why securing it is critical to operations.
- ✅ Identified **three threat sources** and corresponding **threat events** based on NIST taxonomy.
- ✅ Scored each threat using a **qualitative scale (1–3)** for likelihood and severity.
- ✅ Calculated **overall risk scores** (likelihood × severity).
- ✅ Proposed specific **security controls** aligned with assessed threats.

## 🛡️ Security Controls Suggested

To mitigate or remediate the identified risks, I proposed the following controls:

- 🔐 **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**  
- 🔄 **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
- 🧩 **AAA Framework** (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)  
- 🧱 **Defense-in-Depth strategy**

These suggestions help ensure layered security and stronger access boundaries.

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

This project demonstrated how to apply cybersecurity risk assessment principles in practice. I learned to **think strategically** about risks, **communicate vulnerabilities**, and **recommend controls** that align with both **technical priorities** and **organizational goals**.
