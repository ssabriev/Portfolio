# 📘 Portfolio Activity: Use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to Respond to a Security Incident

## 🧩 Course Context  
**Module:** Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security  
**Program:** Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate  
**Platform:** [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity)

## 📝 Description  
In this portfolio activity, I applied the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) to a simulated security incident scenario. The task involved analyzing the situation using the five core functions of the NIST CSF—**Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover**—to develop a professional-level response and mitigation strategy.

The goal was to demonstrate knowledge of how to maintain, secure, and restore the integrity of network infrastructure during and after a cybersecurity incident.
