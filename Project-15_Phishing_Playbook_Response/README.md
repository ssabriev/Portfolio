# 📧 Portfolio Activity: Use a Playbook to Respond to a Phishing Incident  

## 📚 Course Context  
**Module:** Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response  
**Program:** Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate

## 🎯 Activity Overview  

In this project, I practiced **using an incident response playbook** to address a phishing attack scenario. The exercise simulated how security analysts identify, contain, eradicate, and recover from a phishing incident.  

By following a structured playbook, I documented each response step, analyzed the phishing attempt, and recommended mitigation strategies to reduce the likelihood of recurrence.
