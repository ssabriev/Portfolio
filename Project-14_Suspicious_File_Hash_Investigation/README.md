# 🕵️ Portfolio Activity: Investigate a Suspicious File Hash  

## 📚 Course Context  
**Module:** Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response  
**Program:** Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate  

---

## 🎯 Activity Overview  

In this project, I investigated a **suspicious file hash** as part of a simulated security incident. The activity required performing basic threat intelligence analysis by researching the hash value to determine if the file was malicious.  

The investigation involved identifying file metadata, cross-referencing the hash against threat intelligence databases, and documenting findings that could support an incident response report. This exercise emphasized the importance of validating file integrity and detecting potential malware.
